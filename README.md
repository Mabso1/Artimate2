# Artimate2
This repository contains the code for analysing the data belonging to the field trials experiments in SÃ¸nderjylland.

The repo contains two folders, one with preprocessed data (named data) and a folder with the code for the analysis (named code). The code is split up into three different scripts, with the first utilized for preprocessing, plotting, and doing summary statistics (script name: field_trials_bio_data_preprocessing). The second script (script name: HIMA_testing) applies mixture PCA for the abiotic components and conducts the analysis in HIMA, providing a candidate list of mediators. The third script sets up and evaluates the SEM model (script name:sem_model). Note that each script must be run from 1 to 3 (in that order) to make the analysis work. 

In addition to the data provided at our repo, a Zenodo page has also been created, which contains the DOI for our dataset, which you may cite if you find the data helpful.
