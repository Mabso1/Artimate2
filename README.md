# Artimate2
This repository contains the code for analysing the data belonging to the field trials experiments in SÃ¸nderjylland.

The repo contains two folders, one with preprocssed data (named data) and a fold with the code for the analysis (named code). The code is split up into three different scripts with the first utalized for preprocessing, plotting and doing summaray statististic (script name: field_trials_bio_data_preprocessing). The second script (script name: HIMA_testing) is applying mixture PCA for the abotic compoents and conducting the analysis in HIMA providing a candidate list of mediators. The third script sets up and evaultes the SEM model (script name:sem_model). Note that each script must be run from 1 to 3 (in that order) to make the analysis work. 

In addtion to the data provided at our repo, a Zenodo page is also created which contains the DOI for our dataset which you my cite if you find the data helpful.
